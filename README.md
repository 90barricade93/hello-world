# hello-world
A short description for the interested at GitHub. I am getting education to become a certified python developer. First I started with development essentials, that covers HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. Then an 8-day course for Python will start. Followed by a 3-day introduction to DevOps and agile. And we will end with 2 days of effective communication.
