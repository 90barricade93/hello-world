I've written a brief description for those who are interested. I am taking classes to become a certified Python developer. As a starter, I started with the development essentials course, which covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a bit of a taste. Then an 8-day Python course will start. Followed by a 3-day introduction to DevOps and agile. Lastly, we are going to spend two days focusing on effective communication.

I would like to thank ITMG and REACT-EU for this.
